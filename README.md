# Snake and Ladder Game

Welcome to the Snake and Ladder game project! This project aims to create a fully functional web app version of the classic game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 10x10 grid board with players represented by tokens moving based on dice rolls. It includes ladders that move the player up and snakes that move the player down, displays the current player's turn, provides a button to roll the dice, visually updates the board and tokens after each move, detects and declares the winner when a player reaches the last square exactly, and includes a reset button to start a new game.

## Code Explanation
The Snake and Ladder game is implemented using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure the code is self-contained and does not rely on any external libraries. The game logic is set up to handle player movements, ladder climbs, snake descents, dice rolls, turn switching, win detection, and game resets. All aspects of the game are designed to be responsive for various screen sizes.
