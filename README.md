# Snake and Ladder Game

This project is a fully functional Snake and Ladder game implemented as a web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 10x10 grid board with players represented by tokens moving based on dice rolls. It includes ladders that move the player up and snakes that move the player down. The game displays the current player's turn, provides a button to roll the dice, visually updates the board and tokens after each move, detects and declares the winner when a player reaches the last square exactly, and includes a reset button to start a new game.

## Setup

## Usage

- Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice and move the player token.

## Code Explanation
